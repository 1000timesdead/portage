# It's broken and mostly unusable, here for testers

## Sorry, folks. Due to bad design when I first started this
## overlay, and due to the fact that there is no portage compatible
## implementation that can deal with overlays rejecting main repository
## ebuilds this is necessary. Will try to keep this kind of thing to a
## minimum in the future.
#
## Could not do moves due to dependencies, so all these need to be
## manually uninstalled and the appropriate -9999 ebuild need to be
## installed, sorry for the inconvience.
